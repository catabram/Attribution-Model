# Attribution-Model

In digital advertising, attribution is the problem of assigning credit to one or more advertisements for driving the user to the desirable actions such as making a purchase. Rather than giving all the credit to the last ad a user sees, multi- touch attribution allows more than one ads to get the credit based on their corresponding contributions.

Multi-touch attribution is one of the most important problems in digital advertising, especially when multiple media channels, such as search, display, social, mobile and video are involved. Due to the lack of statistical framework and a viable modeling ap- proach, true data-driven methodology does not exist today in the industry.

While predictive modeling has been thor- oughly researched in recent years in the digital advertising domain, the attribution problem focuses more on accurate and stable interpretation of the influence of each user inter- action to the final user decision rather than just user clas- sification. 

Traditional classification models fail to achieve those goals.
